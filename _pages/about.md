I'm a Professor of Practice in the Department of Management, Strategy, & Entrepreneurship in the Cox School of Business at Southern Methodist University (SMU).

I obtained my Ph.D. from the University of Alabama in the area of Organizational Behavior and Human Resources. My primary research interests revolve around the work-life interface, leadership, managerial competencies, employee identity, HR practices, technical workflows, organizational reputation, and people analytics. 

Prior to joining SMU, I was a research scientist at Amazon doing applied research on employee safety in warehouses. Prior to joining Amazon, I spent ~5 years as a tenure-track faculty member in the Department of Management at the University of Texas at Arlington, and 2 years on faculty at New Mexico State University. Prior to joining academia, I worked in a variety of roles, including management, in the service industry.
